# RKE2

We're starting to experiment with our next-generation Kubernetes distribution. This is currently an alpha project that will evolve a lot. Stay tuned.

## What is this?

RKE2 is a fully compliant Kubernetes distribution, with the following changes:

- Packaged as a single binary.
- Kubelet running as an embedded process in the agent and server.
- Master components running as static pods.
- All components images are compiled using Goboring library.
- The following addons are installed as helm charts:
  - CoreDNS
  - Kube-proxy
  - Canal
  - Nginx Ingress Controller
  - Metrics Server

## Installation

RKE2 comes with a convenient and configurable installation script that handles OS configuration, binary release download, and installation of an openrc init script or systemd unit file. 

### Quick Start

The `install.sh` script provides a convenient way for installing rke2 server and agent, to install rke2 service:

```sh
INSTALL_RKE2_VERSION=v0.0.1-alpha.7 ./install.sh
```

### CIS Mode

If you plan to run your RKE2 cluster in CIS mode, the installation script offers the ability to install RKE2 in preparation for this. Use the `INSTALL_RKE2_CIS_MODE` environment variable. This will configure the system for RKE2 to run in CIS compliant mode. This includes the creation of a user "etcd", updates a number of kernel parameters, and installs a systemd or openrc unit file that passes the CIS mode flag to the binary (`--profile=cis-1.5`). Please reference the installation script (`install.sh`) for CIS specifics.

```sh
INSTALL_RKE2_CIS_MODE=true INSTALL_RKE2_VERSION=v0.0.1-alpha.7 ./install.sh
```

*NOTE*
RKE2 can be run in CIS mode without running the install script in CIS mode however the remediations will need to be done manually. 

### Post Installation

A kubeconfig is written to `/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml`, the install script will install rke2 and additional binaries such as `kubectl`, `ctr`, `rke2-uninstall.sh`.

## Operation

To start using the rke2 cluster:

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml
kubectl get nodes
```

`RKE2_TOKEN` is created at `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/node-token` on your server. To install on worker nodes we should pass `RKE2_URL` along with `RKE2_TOKEN` or `RKE2_CLUSTER_SECRET` environment variables, for example:

```sh
RKE2_URL=https://myserver:6443 RKE2_TOKEN=XXX ./install.sh
```

## Automated deployment

We provide a simple automated way to install RKE2 on AWS via terraform scripts, this method requires terraform to be installed and access to AWS cloud, to get started please checkout the [rke2-build](https://github.com/rancher/rke2-build) repo.

## Creating a Release

RKE2 is drive by versioned releases in association with runtime and Kubernetes versions. They can be found in the Release section of the repository. 

Follow the steps below to create a new RKE2 release:

* Go to [Releases](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases)
* Click "Daft a new release"
* Add the "Tag version"
* Click "Publish release"
  
Assets won't appear immediately. There is a Drone publish job that will need to complete and it will be responsible for pushing the assets into Github for that release.
